Boa noite gente, tudo bem desse lado dai? Eu espero que sim!

Estou no mundo da programa√ß√£o tem muito pouco tempo, e cada vez mais encantada com as possibilidades que esse mundo poder√° me proporcionar! (E j√° tem me proporcionado!)



Tenho estudado, tenho treinado e claro, como um bom Jr, estou a procura do meu primeiro sim!



Essa semana estive participando da Semana React Js, do Matheus, uma pessoa incr√≠vel que conheci atrav√©s do Youtube, e acompanhei e construi essa p√°gina utilizando React Js, com meus links das minhas redes sociais.



Foi suadeira viu? N√£o foi f√°cil n√£o, mas enche meu cora√ß√£o de orgulho!



Deixo aqui meu agradecimento a essas pessoas que auxiliam quem est√° iniciando na √°rea e que n√£o nos deixa desistir! Sem a ajuda de voc√™s isso n√£o seria poss√≠vel! Existe nessas redes muito conte√∫do bacana e gratuito pra construir v√°rias aplica√ß√µes!! E claro, al√©m de te fazer treinar o fortalecer seus conhecimentos iniciais!



Estou muito contente em ter conseguido!



Deixo aqui meu link pra voc√™s irem l√° dar uma espiadinha!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
